##What is IpLookup##
IpLookup is a Java library used to get country and other relevant info out of the IP Address.

Currently, we use 4 services:

   * http://www.geobytes.com
   * http://api.ipinfodb.com
   * http://www.webyield.net
   * http://whatismyipaddress.com

and this lib is very extensible, as you can add your own service impl.
