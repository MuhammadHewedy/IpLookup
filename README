Java lib (produces Jar file) used to get country and other relevant info out of the IP Address.

Currently, we use 4 services:

1. http://www.geobytes.com
2. http://api.ipinfodb.com
3. http://www.webyield.net
4. http://whatismyipaddress.com

and this lib is very extensible, as you can add your own service impl.
